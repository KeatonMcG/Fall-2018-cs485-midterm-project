Description
==================================
This repository holds the Assets folder for our cs 485-midterm-project. The game inside is called Defense scheme 
and can be run by downloading the repositoy opening up one of the game scenes and building the project with Unity.
While we did design the game ourselves we did use some tutorials to help implement our ideas as none of our group
members have much experience with Unity. Any tutorials and sound used in the game are listed below.

Controls
==================================
Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate the tower.
Use the spacebar to fire.
